# 🧮 Calculus in Economics – Interactive Visual Models

A bilingual, interactive website demonstrating key calculus applications in economics — including **derivatives** (marginal analysis), **integration** (consumer/producer surplus), and **differential equations** (growth models).

> Built for the *Midterm Project – Calculus × Economics*  
> **Class:** Toán Cao Cấp – HK I (2025) • **Authors:** Thịnh, Thùy, Linh

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
| Section | Concept | Math Representation |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| Derivatives | Marginal revenue/cost | MR = MC |
| Integration | Consumer/Producer Surplus | CS, PS = ½·Q*·ΔP |
| Growth Models | Solow Model | s·f(k) = (δ + n)·k, f(k)=k^α |
